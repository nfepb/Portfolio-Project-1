                Board games bring families and friends of all ages together to connect, strategize, compete, and have fun.  The very foundation of this activity is cooperation, as it requires players to engage with each other through teamwork.

                Whether you’re having to memorize something, keep track of a certain pattern, or do quick math in your head, you’re increasing your mental agility while playing, possibly without even realizing it. Researchers found that those who played more games later in life had better cognitive function in areas including memory, thinking speed, problem solving, and general cognitive ability than those who didn’t engage in game playing.

                    Having fun while playing board games helps get your mind off of negative things going on in your life that may be leading to stress. Taking time off to reset your mind with a positive distraction is one way to relax that many people find to be effective.

                    Any high-quality board game can remove the bad stress from a social situation, while allowing the good stress of friendly competition to remain. Board games do this by offering social settings with people of your choice, and by implementing a structured set of rules and protocol for the social interaction that takes away the burden of improvisation that’s present in other such situations.
