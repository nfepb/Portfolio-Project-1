                            Deck Builders are games that make primarily use of cards. Usually, players start with a
                            limited
                            number of cards, but as the game progresses, players are able to acquire more or better
                            cards,
                            allowing more options (games like Star Realms of Dominion).

                            Combat games are among the eldest type of game still played to this day. Players usually
                            have to
                            defeat one another or defeat another party to win. Strategy can often be a predominant
                            component
                            in this type of game (games like chess or Blood Rage).

                In a Deck Building game, the main element of gameplay is to <strong>construct the best possible deck of
                    cards</strong>.
                The deck is being built by the several players during the game. It usually involves some form of
                currency that allow the players to acquire new or better cards than the ones they originally start with
                at the start of the game. This type of game is most often accessible to any type of player. With all the
                players starting with similar cards, or cards of similar strength, there is most of the time an element
                of randomness involved, allowing a fair chance of winning to any player, regardless of the skill.
